                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>I've made my home base in sunny Los Angeles, California. 
                        My tech journey began as a young blogger figuring out how to 
                        personalize my own small website. Curiosity pushed me to find 
                        ways to change colors, add backgrounds, and bring my words to 
                        life with fun visuals. The world of code intrigued me, and I 
                        had to learn more.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="half-width">
                    <p>As I took classes, I realized that coding not only satisfied 
                        my curiosity, but I had found something that gave me the 
                        freedom and versatility I was looking for in my career. Now I've 
                        made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my 
                        organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant 
                        code.</p>

                    <h3>Hand-coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by 
                        hand to ensure that the content is easy to read, easy to 
                        collaborate with, trouble-shoot, and accessible.</p>

                    <img src="img/css-icon.png" alt="CSS icon" />
                    <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean 
                            and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                    <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                    <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage 
                            that is a pixel-perfect match.</p>
